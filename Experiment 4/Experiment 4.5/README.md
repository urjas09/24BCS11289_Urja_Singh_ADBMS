-- 2.Every Possible Combination: Show every possible combination of 'customer_name' from the 'customers' table and 'product_name' from the 'products' table.

SELECT e1.employee_name AS Employee,
       e2.employee_name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;

SELECT c.customer_name,
       p.product_name
