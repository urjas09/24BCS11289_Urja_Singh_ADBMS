Joins Practice-1
Okay, let's put your SQL JOIN knowledge to the test with some practical problems. We'll use the following tables:

1. customers Table:

customer_id	customer_name	city
1	Alice Smith	New York
2	Bob Johnson	Los Angeles
3	Carol Williams	Chicago
4	David Brown	Houston
5	Emily Davis	Phoenix
6	Luffy	NULL
2. orders Table:

order_id	customer_id	product_name	order_date	quantity
1	1	Laptop	2024-01-15	1
2	1	Mouse	2024-01-15	2
3	2	Keyboard	2024-01-20	1
4	3	Monitor	2024-01-22	1
5	2	Laptop	2024-02-01	2
3. products Table:

product_id	product_name	category_id	price
1	Laptop	1	1200
2	Mouse	2	25
3	Keyboard	2	75
4	Monitor	1	300
5	Webcam	2	60
6	Tablet	3	250
4. categories Table:

category_id	category_name
1	Electronics
2	Accessories
3	Tablets
5. employees Table:

employee_id	employee_name	manager_id	department
1	John Doe	NULL	Sales
2	Jane Smith	1	Sales
3	Peter Jones	1	Marketing
4	Mary Green	3	Marketing
5	Raj	2	Sales
Problems:

Customers and Orders: List the customer_name and order_date for all customers who have placed orders.

All Customers and Their Orders: List all customer names and their corresponding product_name from orders, if they have any. Include customers even if they haven't placed any orders.

Find Products and Their Orders: Display Product Name and the order_date from all the products that are ordered.
